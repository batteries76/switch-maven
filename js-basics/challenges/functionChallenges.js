// Function Problems

// You can copy this code into wherever you are writing your JS. It is just commented JS, and so you can just write your answers directly below the questions. Doing this means that when you send the answers to a teacher, the question comes with the answer.

// Note that in some cases you might need to make a decision about how to deal with 'edge cases'. Feel free to put a comment in your code that ackowledges these edge cases, and that explains how you decided to confront that scenario.

// Some of these might seem a little bit repetative, but this will serve a purpose. If these are easy for you, then you will get through them quickly, but it's still worthwhile, because doing problems like this adds to your muscle memory. They are a bit like drills in a sport - you don't just play matches, you have to practice the basic skills. We need the idea of function definitions and function calls to become second nature. We need people to get used to arguments, and naming the arguments, and return values, and have no issues. It's one thing to hear us talk about these things, or watch us do them, and another to get your hands dirty yourselves. This way the theory becomes the practice, even if at times it can feel a touch repetative.

// 1. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments, and returns the larger of the two.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 2. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments, and returns the smaller of the two.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 3. Write a function that takes three numbers as arguments, and returns the largest of the three.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 4. Write a function that takes three numbers as arguments, and returns the smallest of the three.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 5. Write a function that takes two strings, and returns the result of both strings concatenated together.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 6. Write a function that takes two strings, and returns the one that is first in terms of alphabetical order.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 7. Write a function that takes two strings and returns the shorter string of the two.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 8. Write a function that takes two strings and returns the longer string of the two.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 9. Write a function that takes three strings and returns the longest string.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 10. Write a function that takes three strings and returns the shortest string.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.

// 11. Write a function that takes three numbers as arguments, and returns the middle of the three.
// Call the function 3 times with different arguments.
