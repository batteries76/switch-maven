## Forms Extended Notes

### Forms Outline

My first thought on this day is that the trie stuff might be overdoing it. I haven’t had much experience with them though, and they look really interesting (reminds me of my Comp Sci days). I’m happy to go with it though, and this is more just my initial feeling here. It will depend a lot on the students and where they are at with things so far. It’s a great schedule, but packed, and I wonder if they might be a little fried by this time. 

With forms I would build out a very basic web form in HTML5. Along with this would be a discussion about HTML, and a little about browsers, parsing, and web communication. I’d keep this relatively brief. 

I feel like with forms the emphasis should start with trying to push them to get over the fiddly nature of things at the outset. They have some ‘annoying’ elements, and various oddities that make them a bit of a hassle (hence dubious tools like Form.IO). I would overcome this by part explanation, and part throwing the task back on them to make a few forms, and to get a sense of the building involved. 

Then we would need to chat about where that data is going. This leads to a chat about servers and more on web communication. I think it’s worth a brief discussion of the various ways of communicating between browser and server (url, query strings, forms, fetch). 

Here I would make a very simple web server using express. The absolute basics. In here I would have them send data from the forms, and then console.log out the various incoming data elements.

### Pathway
- HTML5 forms
    - different form types
    - different methods
- HTML5 validations
- Connecting this to the back end, and responses
- Exercise around front to back
- Summarise all the methods of sending data from front to back
- Dealing with data, pre DB
- Make a small app without a DB
