## Schema Challenges
1. Create three models based on some data that you are interested in, or that you might end up using in your project. If you are stuck for ideas you can use albums, artists, and users (the users who will use your app).
2. Perform three different types of validations in your schemas. Try to think through realistic validations that might actually be useful.

## API Challenge
1. Start building out your API to be able to be able to find one record, and edit or delete a record. To do this you are going to use the id (`_id`) of the record. You will need to check through the docs relating to Mongoose to work this out, and create a few more routes. It can be done in various ways, and we will have a chat about these in the future. Have a go first, and see what you can discover. You will also need to ammend the `.http` file to run those requests.
2. If you get through those, you could build out your api to also start being able to cope with the full range of routes for your other models.
