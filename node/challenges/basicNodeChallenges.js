// *Problem 1*
// Define a function fiveTimes which takes a number as an argument and returns the value that results when the argument is multiplied by 5. Define a function hundTimes, which takes and argument and returns the result of that argument being multiplied by 100. Define a function divSeven which takes an argument and returns the result of that argument divided by 7. Define a function numberMangle which takes one argument and which uses only those previously defined functions to multiply that argument by 5, 100, and then divide by 7 - that is, numberMangle will contain no direct calculations. Store that result in a variable.

// *Problem 2*
// Define the function tenMult, which takes one argument (a number), and returns the result of that number multiplied by 10. Define a function called arrMult that takes an array as an argument. In arrMult, use the function tenMult on each element of the array that was passed in as the argument. Return the array that results from this (each element multiplied by 10), and store in a well-named variable.

// *Problem 3*
// Define a well-named function that takes one argument and returns ‘true’ if that argument is even, and false if the argument is an odd number. Define a function ‘divOrMultTwo’ which takes a number as an argument. Using your first defined function, if the number is even this function returns the result of that number divided by 2. If the number is odd it returns the result of that number multiplied by 2. Store the result of a call to this function in a variable.

// *Problem 4*
// Define a function that takes an array of numbers, and returns the total of the addition of all the numbers in the array. Store the result of a call to this function in a well-named variable.

// *Problem 5*
// *Hats (tough)*
// This problem is tough, but fun. Worth a shot - but go on to problem 5 if you are spending too much time on it. 100 students are sitting in a row, and each has a hat on. Their strange teacher (who is probably mad as a hatter from trying to teach 100 students) walks along the line of students (starting from the same end each time). The first time he takes every hat off. On the second pass he toggles the state of every second hat (putting on if off, taking off if on), changing the ‘hat state’ of every even numbered student. The third pass he toggles every third hat. The fourth every fourth, and the fifth every fifth, and so on until he has passed the students 100 times. What is the final state of the hats (ie, which students have a hat on or off)?
