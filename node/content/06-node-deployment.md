## Deployment

### NGinx and PaaS Outline

Honestly these are not strong areas for me. I gave deployed a heap to Heroku, and also Netlify for static sites. 

This topic would start a broad discussion about deployment that would (could) include a brief overview of getting off local and into the world, and then some of the modern tools to achieve that. 

I could right now go through Heroku and Netlify, but will need more time to talk about other options. I could chat through some of the plus and minus of different systems, and of different capabilities (db, etc). 

This area could lead to a discussion if environments, and of build tools, and very basic dev ops, as well as containers and container management. Some of this could cycle back around to operating systems, and platforms, servers, and languages. 

### Pathway
- What is deployment
- Simple options (Netlify, Now)
- Heroku and apps
- Builds
- NGinX
- Dev ops concepts (extension)
