// Classes Challenges

// 1. Make a structure that follows the same concept as the continents, countries, and cities that we looked at in regular JS.
// Use the new class syntax, and instantiate at least three continents, at least three countries, and at least three cities, and give them the appropriate attributes. (Please think ahead so that you have at least one path that will be continent through country to cities that makes geographical sense.)
// Each will have (at least) a name attribute, and an array to store items of smaller geographical size. (Continents will have a 'countries' array for adding Country objects.)
// For each of these classes, include an instance method that you are going to use to add the child class in. So, for example, the Continent class will have an instance method (a function that works on an instance, or object, created from the class). 
// Now build up the larger structure from these smaller pieces, to create a 'world'.
// The test will be whether you can access a city name within the structure, starting with the continent variable name. 

// 2. Plan out a small segment of a banking app. 
// You will need to consider what classes you'll need. My suggestion would be to start with a class representing the bank account, and start there. Then you will maybe think about branches, and employees, and other options. 
// If you are finding this task difficult, please DM me for help and suggestions.
// Also, please try to really think through the edge cased for your methods on this one, and make this as robust as possible.
