## React Starter Challenge

### Starter Challenge 
1. Basic JSX
Take your portfolio website, and rewrite it using JSX. You don't need to add all the CSS, but you should try to put the components in the right places.
2. Component separation
Now take each of the sections and put them into components. Nest the components as needed, and use this time to get used to the idea of components and nesting of components.
3. Add a simple state, and have some of the state render in the view.
4. Pass some elements of state through to the components via props. You will need to think about what you would like to write in your bio or contact info, and for practice, store this in state, and then pass it down as props. Then render it as part of the appropriate component.
5. Conditionally render some elements in App.
6. Create a button and attach a function that will conditionally render some components in the app.
