tomorrow: scope, continued review and integration of functions. boolean functions to clean complex logic. Another task making use of logic and functions to build a widget in the browser - potentially the can learn the basic localhost API (veeery simple) to store simple values for use later
3:15
wednesday - gap day. potentially an advanced self directed project, but preferable, intro to arrays. I don't know the nature of the holiday...can we expect them to work through it? unclear
3:15
but an interesting moment to deploy a video lesson about arrays, and see how the folks that try it like it
3:17
thursday - arrays and while loop. super simple. basic array syntax and methods, push, pop, etc. some kind of browser linkage? possible to store data and do some kind of matching or retrival, especially with local storage api
3:19
friday - assessment. harder function problems, basic array and local storage problems. last question has them build something in the browser, medium logic
3:20
next week - condense soft skills into two 1h 1/2 sessions
3:21
monday for loop, objects , for loops for objects,
3:21
tuesday - new, this

Need: fetch, 
Qs: 
- Have you seen my content?
- Promises earlier

W2
