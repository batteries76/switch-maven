### Mike's message

The first three weeks have been absolutely crazy. But the dust is settling, and we're finding a rhythm. In general, we're doing pretty good - the students took an anonymous survey last week, and the consensus is that students are engaged and enjoying the program.

As always, there are problems to solve, but we're in a much better position to solve them.

We've made a lot of program changes on the fly. We've had a lot of great great ideas from many conversations. This brief aims to capture all of those ideas and changes. 

## goals.

The biggest development is a shift in our *goals*. Originally, the camp was designed to take folks who already knew javascript and give them a rundown of cutting edge ideas/tools. But based on the survey, *about half of current cohort have only really played around with programming.* 

*Our goals are now:*

- give them a rock solid, project-based javascript education.
- Have each specialization learn their primary tools (React and Express) inside and out.
- And give them real experience collaborating, using professional tools/paradigms like TDD and Git

*At the end of the camp, students will have a simple but battle-tested toolset, and will be ready to perform junior-level dev work with the node stack.* 

We have a lot of flexibility and leeway to achieve this - we can go as slow as we need. Which brings us to...

## curriculum.

*Big changes* 

- reducing soft skills to two sessions//week
- moving CS sessions to the *end* of the program
- deferring promises/async until we're a couple sessions into node

 

Schedule may vary based on student progress.

*Week 4*

Monday - arrays, loops, and objects.

Tuesday - this, new

soft skills session 1

Wednesday - Full day review and integration

Thursday -  callbacks

soft skills session 2

Friday - assessments

weekend - events

*Week 5 - Hard JS concepts*

monday - events

tuesday - fetch/networking (promises)

wednesday - more fetch(), stack frames??

thursday -  jeez, more fetch()

friday - Assess

*Week 6 - building the simplest complete app with Express.js*

## delivery schedule.

WE'RE TESTING OUT NEW IDEAS - MAKE SURE TO READ *teaching style*.

Monday, 20th

am: Mike
pm: Matt
pm+: Mike again?

Tuesday - 21st

am: Mike
pm: Dhanya
pm+: Joel

Wednesday - 22nd

am: Mike
pm: Matt
pm+: Mike again?

Thursday - 23rd

am: Mike
pm: Dhanya
pm+: Joel

Friday - 24th

am: hasini
pm: 

We'll continue with this structure until we start node.js, then *Matt will be morning teacher*. 

## teaching style.

Two big new developments: some curriculum will be developed and delivered as *video lessons,* and each week or subject will have a *morning teacher* and *afternoon teachers.* We'll all have turns at being both. 

*videos / the blended approach*

Here's the thing. We want a curriculum we can leverage next go around, and that we can share with other teachers. But whenever a new teacher has to learn the curriculum, each teacher ends up customizing it, making it their own - *effectively rewriting it.* 

So we're testing out a combination of video content (reusable) and short presentations (custom, personal, easy for teachers to create). 

*A day would look like this:*

Morning

- Open with a live lecture, schedule for the day
- transition the students to going through video and doing short exercies
    - Emphasis on rapid feedback here
- Close with a live lecture - Q&A, Reinforcement based on results from short exercises
- Morning teacher posts a short debrief on course status, student progress, problems etc in slack

Afternoon

- students work through a large body of challenges
- we set some kind of expectation about how far they should get
- Afternoon teacher can, if they choose, do live demos based on issues students are having, though preference is for them to working through the exercises
- At the end, Afternoon teacher closes class, and does light transition - either to soft skills, or to project session
- Afternoon teacher posts short debrief in slack

Evening

- On non-soft skill days, students are given open ended prompts to use the concepts in a project.
- at first, projects are short - no longer than a session.
    - Later, week long.
    - after that, in teams
    - after that, month long (end of course)

tomorrow: scope, continued review and integration of functions. boolean functions to clean complex logic. Another task making use of logic and functions to build a widget in the browser - potentially the can learn the basic localhost API (veeery simple) to store simple values for use later
3:15
wednesday - gap day. potentially an advanced self directed project, but preferable, intro to arrays. I don't know the nature of the holiday...can we expect them to work through it? unclear
3:15
but an interesting moment to deploy a video lesson about arrays, and see how the folks that try it like it
3:17
thursday - arrays and while loop. super simple. basic array syntax and methods, push, pop, etc. some kind of browser linkage? possible to store data and do some kind of matching or retrival, especially with local storage api
3:19
friday - assessment. harder function problems, basic array and local storage problems. last question has them build something in the browser, medium logic
3:20
next week - condense soft skills into two 1h 1/2 sessions
3:21
monday for loop, objects , for loops for objects,
3:21
tuesday - new, this

Need: fetch, 
Qs: 
- Have you seen my content?
- Promises earlier

W2
Thurs: Arrays into objects (Mike: more functions II - input and output)

W3
Mon: Objects into functions (Mike: functions III, callbacks)
Tues: Callbacks (Mike: Arrays and loops, and basic objects)
Wed: Promises (Mike: objects and this)
Thurs: Review
