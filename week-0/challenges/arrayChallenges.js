// Array Challenges

// 1. Make an array of 3 different colours.
// 2. How do I access "blue" using an index.
// 3. Store the string blue (which you accessed with an index) in a variable.
// 4. Create an array called fourLetterAnimals with the following animals (in this order): "calf", "duck", "elephant", "goat", "lamb", "lion", "mule", "dog". Add "puma" to the end of the array. Insert "joey" after "goat" and before "lamb". Delete "dog". Reverse the order of the array. Replace "elephant" with "foal". Add "bear" to the end of the array. Reverse the order of the array again.
// 5. Create an array with 10 animals you'd find at the zoo.
// 6. Access the 3rd, 5th, and last animal using indexes (remember indexes start at 0), store these strings in variables that match the string value.
// 7. Using the variable containing "blue" you created in question 3 create a control flow structure whereby if the variable `colour` is "blue" print out "blue dub a deee dub a diii", else print out "some other colour".
// 8. How do we insert a new string into our animals array? There are many ways to do this - use a method that you haven't used already.
// 9. Find a way to remove the first element of the array (again, there are several options here, so search the internet for a solution).
// 10. The zoo is cutting down on costs and needs to now transfer some animals to another zoo. Find a way to remove the final five items in the animals array.
// 11. The owner of the zoo won the lottery and can now bring back those same five animals. How do we do this with a JS array method rather than just hard coding a new animals array? Use a range of methods in your answer if possible.
// 12. The zoo owner has now lost track of how many animal types are in her zoo. Find out how many animals are in the array using a JS array method.
// 13. The zoo owner wants to know if their zoo contains monkeys. Find a way to check if the array contains monkeys using a JS array method.   
// 14. The zoo owner wants to have their animals sorted in alphabetical order because they're trying to be more organized. Achieve this using an array method.
// 15. Ask the user for three or more grocery items, store them in an array. It's OK to ask three times. Show the list to the user. Can’t remember how to use a specific JS feature/syntax? That’s normal! Google + JS docs. Try using the `.length` method to inform the user how many items are in their list. Sort the list alphabetically before showing it to the user. Are you using `prompt` multiple times? A loop might tidy your code. If the user tries to add 'Ice Cream', secretly replace it with 'Broccoli'. Now ask the user for quantities too. Show a nice looking list back to the user.
